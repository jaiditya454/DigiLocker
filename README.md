INTRODUCTION
In today's digital age, ensuring the integrity, authentication, and confidentiality of sensitive 
documents has become paramount. The Digilocker project addresses the pressing need for a 
secure and efficient digital document storage and retrieval system. This system allows users 
to securely sign in or sign up, gaining access to their personal repository of documents, 
including vital records like Aadhar.
The significance of this project lies in safeguarding the authenticity and privacy of user data. 
With increasing reliance on digital documents, the risk of unauthorized access and tampering 
has escalated. Existing solutions have made strides in digital storage but often fall short in 
ensuring the holistic security of documents.
Our project's key contributions revolve around implementing robust encryption and 
decryption mechanisms using RSA and AES algorithms. These algorithms not only guarantee 
data confidentiality but also provide strong authentication measures, ensuring that only 
authorized users can access their documents.
By prioritizing integrity, authentication, and confidentiality, the Digilocker project aims to set 
a new standard in digital document management, empowering users with a trusted and secure 
platform for their sensitive information.


OBJECTIVES
The objectives of our project can be summarized as follows:
• Implementing a secure sign-in/sign-up process for users.
• Facilitating secure document retrieval and storage with encryption and decryption 
using RSA and AES.

IMPLEMENTATION AND RESULT ANALYSIS 
• Each citizen have their unique citizen pin provided by government. If client enters his 
citizen pin correctly, he can get his documents from respective servers to digiLocker 
server
